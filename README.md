# SQL
My SQL queries for CareerFoundry's Data Analyst Program. 
It contains queries used for the Rockbuster LLC project, a fictional company that offers a streaming service
The data was downloaded as a ZIP file and then uploaded to an SQL database (PostgreSQL)
I used SQL to manipulate the data and gain insights on it to answer the following questions:

● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
● What was the average rental duration for all videos?
● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
